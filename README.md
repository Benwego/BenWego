I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in Communications, where I developed a strong understanding of PR and marketing strategies. I spent the last couple of years gaining experience in digital marketing and content creation. Iâ€™ve always wanted to work in some form of media because of my love for pop culture and brands. 
My experience in marketing extends to when I was a Marketing Intern at an Events Group, email campaigns and event promotions. Sheesh Media as a journalist and content creator, where I was responsible for creating articles and content ideas around music and pop culture. More recently, Iâ€™ve been building on my data-driven marketing skills through becoming a Business Intelligence Analyst through TripleTen bootcamp.
